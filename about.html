			<p class="textreg">Throughout my life drawing was the one thing which I could not imagine living without. I used to always doodle on scraps of paper as a kid, drawing different characters from my favorite cartoons. This passion for drawing stayed with me throughout the time, although, at some points my relationship with drawing was complicated, I always returned to it in the end. Drawing is the medium which helps me to convey myself and my feelings best. <br> <br> <br>

Although my works are not limited to digital or traditional illustrations, I often explore other mediums like animation, interactive installation or sculpture. When doing so, I always try to bring in the drawing aspect into my projects.
<br>
<br>
<br>
In my works and  illustrations I tend to focus a lot on characters, their designs or their stories. Characters that are featured in my drawings are usually my own characters, who in some sense are self-referential and whom I always give something from me – be it a personality trait or a piece of clothing I own. At the same time, being really into fandoms and modern popular culture, I do a lot of fanart illustrations which feature characters from an already existing media.
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
Apart from the character aspect, I put heavy emphasis on the fashion aspect in my illustrations. Taking inspiration from the 1960-1970’s fashion, illustrations and posters, my style is heavily inspired by the period. Vivid colors, bold shapes, and exaggerated poses are some of the highlights of my drawing style.
<br>

<br>
<br>
Material-wise, I am mostly a digital artist and in my works I like to imitate the traditional feeling and materials with digital tools. However, I am not limiting myself only to digital tools, and I often create traditional illustrations and prints. Texture, materials and the tactility experience are other important parts in my works to which I pay a lot of attention.
<br>
<br>
<br>
I am always trying to experiment, be it with materials, narratives or styles and I feel that is something that is evident in the work I'm creating.
